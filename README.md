# image_grapher
A image graphing application made in Godot.

While standard school calculators and Desmos is great and all, I noticed there was a severe lack of cats being graphed. This application gives you the ability to do away with
boring old lines and instead graph images, such as cats.

This can be used to mathmatically produce supplemental art pieces for your projects.
